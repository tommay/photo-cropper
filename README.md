# photo-cropped
Work-in-progress photo cropper.

I really don't like the way every software photo cropper (usually part
of an image editing program or web site) handdles cropping: by
dragging a rectangle over a portion to crop, then going back and forth
between previews and adjusting the crop to fine tune things.

So I'm doing my own.

The crop frame will remain fixed while the image is panned and zoomed
behnd it.  Similar things can be done using layers in Inkscape and
Gimp but it's not easy to do the final crop or to change crop ratios.
